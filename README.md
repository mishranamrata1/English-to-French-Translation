# English-to-French-Translation
Welcome to the English to French Translation Jupyter Notebook! 

This notebook serves as a demonstration and implementation of a translation model that translates English text into French. The project aims to showcase the use of machine translation techniques for language conversion.

# Contents
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Loading and cleaning the dataset.
   - Tokenization and handling missing values.

2. Model Building:
   - Utilizing transformer-based architectures for translation.
   - Fine-tuning the model on the specific English to French translation task.

3. Inference:
   - Translating English sentences into French using the trained model.
   - Examining translation quality and handling edge cases.

4. Evaluation:
   - Assessing the translation accuracy and fluency.
   - Comparing the model's performance against benchmark metrics
